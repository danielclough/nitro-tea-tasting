Nitrogen is the most abundant component of our atmosphere. 
78 percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen
Since there is so much already present in the air and concentrate it by removing the larger oxygen molecules.

When carbon dioxide is dissolved in water a small amount of carbonic acid is formed. Acids have a sour taste.

The low solubility of Nitrogen gives a creamy feel as unable to be disolved, very small bubbles form in the tea.
20 milligrams of N2 will dissolve in one liter of water compared to 1,750 milligrams of CO2.

Nitrogen is nonreactive under normal conditions. 

In a a process called degassing, the pressurized nitrogen replaces the oxygen in solution and prevents spoiling.

Liquid nitrogen has a boiling temperature of -320 degrees Fahrenheit (-196 degrees Celsius)
